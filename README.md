### What is CytoPipelineUtils?

`CytoPipelineUtils` is meant to be used in conjunction with `CytoPipeline` 
 package (see [here](https://github.com/UCLouvain-CBIO/CytoPipeline)), 
 which provides support for automation and visualization of flow cytometry data 
 analysis pipelines. `CytoPipelineUtils` provides a series of
 wrapper implementations that can in turn be defined as CytoProcessingSteps
 in CytoPipeline. It is therefore a helper package, which is aimed at hosting 
 wrapper implementations of various functions of various packages.  

`CytoPipelineUtils` is open to contributions. If you want to implement your 
own wrapper of your favourite pre-processing function and use it in a 
`CytoPipeline` object, this is the place to do it! 
If you do so, please issue a 
[pull request](https://github.com/UCLouvain-CBIO/CytoPipelineUtils/pulls).
