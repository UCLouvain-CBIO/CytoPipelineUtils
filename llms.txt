### What is CytoPipelineUtils?

`CytoPipelineUtils` is meant to be used in conjunction with
`CytoPipeline` package (see
[here](https://github.com/UCLouvain-CBIO/CytoPipeline)), which provides
support for automation and visualization of flow cytometry data analysis
pipelines. `CytoPipelineUtils` provides a series of wrapper
implementations that can in turn be defined as CytoProcessingSteps in
CytoPipeline. It is therefore a helper package, which is aimed at
hosting wrapper implementations of various functions of various
packages.

`CytoPipelineUtils` is open to contributions. If you want to implement
your own wrapper of your favourite pre-processing function and use it in
a `CytoPipeline` object, this is the place to do it! If you do so,
please issue a [pull
request](https://github.com/UCLouvain-CBIO/CytoPipelineUtils/pulls).
